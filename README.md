This is a bit experimentation on python automation with Selenium web driver.

This application fill the signup form and hit the submit button repeatedly which essentially creates a large ammount of POST request to the backend.

This requires the `req.txt` packages installed for python.
Install with,
1.create an conda environment first
```bash
$ conda create --name Selenium python=3.7.3
```
2. Activate the environment.
```bash
conda activate selenium.
```
3.Install the packages
```bash
$ pip install -r req.txt
```
4.You have to download chrome web driver based on google chrome current version.
You can google it. It's pretty simple.

Thank you,
